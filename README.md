###136. Single Number [Solution] (https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/136_SingleNumber.c)
**Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.**                   
*Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?*            

###151. Reverse Words in a String [Solution] (https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/151_ReverseWords.c)
** Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.                                                               
For example, 
  Given s = "the sky is blue", 
  return "blue is sky the".
**                   
*Note: For C programmers: Try to solve it in-place in O(1) space.*
