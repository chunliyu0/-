###288. Unique Word Abbreviation [Solution 1] (https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/288_ValidWordAbbr.java) [Solution 2] (https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/288_ValidWordAbbr2.java)
**An abbreviation of a word follows the form <first letter><number><last letter>. Below are some examples of word abbreviations:**<br>
(a)it                      --> it    (no abbreviation)<br>
(b)d|o|g                   --> d1g<br>
(c)i|nternationalizatio|n  --> i18n<br>
(d)l|ocalizatio|n          --> l10n<br>
**Assume you have a dictionary and given a word, find whether its abbreviation is unique in the dictionary. A word's abbreviation is unique if no other word from the dictionary has the same abbreviation.**
**for example, Given dictionary = [ "deer", "door", "cake", "card" ], **
**isUnique("dear") -> false,**  
**isUnique("cart") -> true,**
**isUnique("cane") -> false,**
**isUnique("make") -> true**

###290. Word Pattern [Solution] (https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/290_WordPattern.java)
**Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.**</br>
**Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.**</br>
**Examples:</br>
**pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return true.**</br>
**pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish" should return false.**</br>
**pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return false.**</br>
**pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog" should return false.**</br>
*Notes:You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.*</br>

###326. Power of Three [Solution] (https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/326_PowerOfThree.java)
**Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.**</br>
**Follow up: Could you do it without using any loop / recursion?**

###338. Counting Bits [Solution] (https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/338_CountingBits.c)
**Given a non negative integer number num. **
**For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.**
**Example: For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].**

###347. Top K Frequent Elements [Solution] (https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/347_TopKFrequent.java)
**Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.**
**For example, Given [1,1,1,2,2,3] and k = 2, return [1,2].**</br>
*Note: (1) you may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.</br>
       (2) Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size..* 

###342. Power of Four [Solution] (https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/342_PowerOfFour.c)
**Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.**</br>
**Example: Given num = 16, return true. Given num = 5, return false.**</br>
**Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?**

###349.  Intersection of Two Arrays [Solution] (https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/349_IntersectionOfTwoArrays.c)
**Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.**
**Example: Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2].**
*Note: Each element in the result must be unique.The result can be in any order.*

###350.  Intersection of Two Arrays II [Solution] (https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/350_IntersectionOfTwoArraysII.c)
**Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.**</br>
**Example: Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2, 2].**</br>
*Note:Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.The result can be in any order..*</br>
