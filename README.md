###21. Merge Two Sorted Lists [Recursive Solution](https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/21_MergeSortedLists.c)   [FindAll-Relink Solution](https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/21_MergeSortedLists2.c)      
**Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.**                                      

###23. Merge K Sorted Lists [Merge-Sort Solution](https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/23_MergeKSortedLists.c)
**Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity.**

###26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array [Solution](https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/26_RemoveDuplicates.c) 
**Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.**
**Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.**                         
**For example, Given input array nums = [1,1,2], Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.**        

###66. Plus One [Solution in c](https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/66_PlusOne.c)        [Solution in java](https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/66_PlusOne.java)
**Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits, plus one to the number.**                                    **The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.**                            

###88. Merge Sorted Array [Solution] (https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/88_MergeSortedArrays.c)
**Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.**                              
*Note: You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2. The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.*  

###136. Single Number [Solution] (https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/136_SingleNumber.c)
**Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.**                   
*Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?*            

###151. Reverse Words in a String [Solution] (https://github.com/ycl11761/Leetcode/blob/master/151_ReverseWords.c)
**Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.**                                                                     
**For example, Given s = "the sky is blue", return "blue is sky the".**  
*Note: For C programmers: Try to solve it in-place in O(1) space.*
